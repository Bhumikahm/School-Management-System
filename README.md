   cd school-management
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   # Database Configuration
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_USER=root
   DB_PASSWORD=your_password
   DB_NAME=school_management

   # JWT Configuration
   JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production

   # Email Configuration (Gmail)
   EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password

   # Next.js Configuration
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-nextauth-secret-key
   ```

4. **Set up MySQL Database**
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE school_management;
   USE school_management;
   ```
   
   The application will automatically create the required tables on first run.

5. **Configure Email (Gmail)**
   - Enable 2-factor authentication on your Gmail account
   - Generate an App Password
   - Use the App Password in EMAIL_PASS

6. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

7. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

  password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  is_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)
```

### OTP Verification Table
```sql
otps (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INT NOT NULL,
  otp_code VARCHAR(6) NOT NULL,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
)
